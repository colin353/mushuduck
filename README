WHAT IS THIS THING?
----------------------------------------------------

It is a program for connecting a Python program on your computer, by implenting
the JActionableRequestHandler to do whatever tasks you want, and responding to
requests from a web-based client. 

It allows you to write a web application that communicates exclusively via WebSocket
in Python, which will hopefully be useful to me in the future.

----------------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE SERVER
----------------------------------------------------

You'll need Python installed, and you'll want to support all of the modules 
listed in the top of server.py. Then you'll want to configure the configuration
options in both server.py and main.coffee to fit your system. 

Finally, do

python server.py

and then open in your browser

http://127.0.0.1:8888/

(note that this URL might be different - consult the configuration options that
you set up in server.py) and this will load up the webpage and you'll get started. 

----------------------------------------------------
COMPILING THE COFFEESCRIPT
you need a coffeescript compiler (e.g. node.js) to 
turn coffeescript into Javascript.
----------------------------------------------------

The preferred coffeescript compile routing is to move into the code directory, then run

coffee -wc --join main.js js

which will compile all of the files together into the main.js Javascript file.
